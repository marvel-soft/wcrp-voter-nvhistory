Annie, if you become the NVGOP State party chairman, in a few words, what is your charge to the states delegates and constituents to take the party forward.

1) nvvoter0 -> required values from voter roles for subsequent programs (votervalues)
2) nvvoter1 -> converts the stream of vote produced by the state to a list by voter (voterdata)
3) csvsort voter values - csvsort -c 1 -e Latin1 votervalues.csv > votervalues-s.csv
4) nvvoter2 creates voter analysis extracts (voterstat)
5) csvsort voter stats - csvsort -c 1 -e Latin1 voterstat.csv > voterstat-s.csv
6) nvvoter3 produce load tables from prior programs and an email list (base)
